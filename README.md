# Overview
This is a simple CRUD app using REST API based on Vue.js and flask. Followed the tutorial by [Michael Herman](https://testdriven.io/blog/developing-a-single-page-app-with-flask-and-vuejs/), but modified the app a bit to avoid using dependency on npm and make it really simple for learning purposes.

# Installation
Go to /server directory and create a python virtual environment:
```
$ python -m venv venv
```
Install required dependencies:
```
$ python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Run server:
```
$ python app.py
```
Once the server is running, go to /client folder and open the client by running `index.html` in a web browser.
